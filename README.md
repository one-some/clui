## Claire Editor
An IDE more or less from scratch. Depends on RayLib for drawing primitives and text until I learn OpenGL, and depends on some of the standard library until I implement the rest.

Forgive the mess, was private until now.

### Features
* Tabs
* Integrated terminal emulator
* Issue reporting via clangd
* Jank syntax highlighting
* Custom standard library (anti-feature?)
* Segfaults
